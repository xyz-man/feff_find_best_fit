Name:           monitor_internet_connection.py
Author:         Martin F. O'Connor (C)
Description:    Monitor Internet connectivity and record time and duration 
                of any downtime.

How to run:		To run this program from the Console/Terminal, type:
					python monitor_internet_connection.py

Date:           23rd June 2019
Version:        1.0

This program checks every X (5) seconds whether the Internet connection
is alive and an external IP address is reachable.
If the Internet connection is unavailable:
    1. The first observed time of failure is logged. 
    2. Every 1-minute interval of subsequent downtime is logged.
    3. When Internet connectivity is restored, the first observed time of 
       restoration is logged. 
    4. Finally, the total duration of the downtime is logged.


Date:           13th January 2020
Version:        1.1

Added functionality to capture Ctrl-C (and SIGINT) and exit the program
gracefully.


Date:           15th January 2020
Version:        1.1.3

Updates:
    1.  Made available as a public package called 'monitor internet connection'.
        on the Python Package Index https://pypi.org/

    2.  Greatly simplified the installation instructions.
        To install: pip install monitor_internet_connection
        To run:     python -m monitor_internet_connection


Date:           16th January 2020
Version:        1.2.0

Updates:
    1. Added the argparse library.
    2. Added command line option to display a help message.
    3. Added command line option to disable the logfile.
       With this option, no write-access to disk is required.
    4. Added command line option to specify the polling frequency in seconds.
       There are nine options available [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60].
    5. When logfile is enabled, verify logfile can be created
       in current working folder.

Date:           27th January 2020
Version:        1.2.1

Updates:
    1. Remove return statement to allow network socket to close.
